== BIN_SHR

Bitwise right-shift with sign preservation of `<number>` by `<shift>` bits.

    BIN_SHR(<number>, <shift>)

Parameters:

_<number>_:: Expression of an integral, unscaled, type (defaults to `INTEGER` for parameters)
_<bits>_:: Expression of type `INTEGER` with the number of bits to shift (value is applied modulus 64, so 64 behaves as 0, 65 as 1)

Returns:

`BIGINT` with right-shift with sign preservation of `<number>` by `<shift>` bits.
