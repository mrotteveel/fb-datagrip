== ASCII_VAL

Returns the ASCII code (character number) for the first character of `<string>`.

    ASCII_VAL(<string>)

Parameters:

_<string>_:: Expression of a string type (defaults to `CHAR(1)` for parameters)

Returns:

`SMALLINT` with the ASCII code (character number) for the first character of `<string>`.
Behavior for characters outside of ASCII depends on the character set of string.
For single byte character sets, it will return the byte value of the character.
For UTF8, characters beyond ASCII will result in an arithmetic overflow error.
